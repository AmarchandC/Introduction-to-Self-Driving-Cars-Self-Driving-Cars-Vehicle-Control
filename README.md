# Introduction to Self-Driving Cars: Self-Driving Vehicle Control
The final project in the first  course in the Self Driving Car specialization offered by Coursera.

# Project Report
Objective: To write and implement a controller for the CARLA simulator. The goal is to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints. The vehicle needs to reach these waypoints at certain desired speeds, so both longitudinal and lateral control will be required.

Part 1: Longitudinal Vehicle control
A simple PID controller was implemented for the longitudinal control of the vehicle. 
The desired speed was the reference input for the controller. The ouputs by the controller were throllle and brake positions.
